Click on Output Name link to set where you want to save the file at. (try to save the files locally in the media drive or on the GraniteStore)

Then click on the Queue Button to send it to Adobe Media Encoder

The Media Encoding may take up to 4 hours so it’s better to try to run these overnight or when no one is using the computer. 

Media Encoder uses a First in First Out method to encode the videos so you can queue a bunch of videos up to run when you aren’t around and it will encode each video one at a time.

You could also encode the DVD files by using the MPEG2-DVD format and use the NTSC DV Wide Preset. You will have to adjust the bitrate settings to get a video file that is close to 4gb in size.

If you have your file trimmed already with the Nexio you can open up the trimmed file with adobe media encoder and use the same encoding settings of H264 BluRay, HD1080i 29.97 and then adjust your bitrate to fit onto the disc without going above 20Mbps
