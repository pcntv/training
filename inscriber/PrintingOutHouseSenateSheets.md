# Updating House or Senate Members

You will need to update 2 google sheets. The **Committee Graphic Finder** and the **Paperless Inscriber Book** And the graphic in the inscriber
  - Go to the Committee Graphic Finder
  - A warning in red should be displaying Saying **Database missmatch** 
    - *This happens when a new member is added or removed from the House or Senate Website*
    - Committee Graphic Finder is Scrapping a list of members from the House and Senate Website
    - There is a hidden Sheet called *Scrape Members* That is doing heavy lifting of scrapping the members Keep the sheet hidden so as not to have anyone accidently change anything on the sheet
  - Go to the MemberChart Sheet
    - The NUMBER | Last | First | Columns are what you need to update if a member leaves or is added
    - Look at Column G *Does it match the website* Any row that says no is the row you need to update
      - Column G is just checking if the Last Name in Column B matches Column E if a member has the same last name Then it will return Yes even though the member has a different first name *so watch out for that*
    - You should be able to see where the problem is and will either need to copy the number and first last name down and then add in the new member.
    - If your not sure what the new members number is look up what their district is. Then see who is in the district before or after theirs then look for that member and add one or subtract one from their number.
      - For Example If the new members district is 101 look up who has district 100 then find their number using your chart then add one to their number and you have the new members number. 
     - Remove the old members number, last, first Then select the numbers names of the members you need to move up or down. ```command c``` to copy them
     Then Select where you want to paste the rows press ```Shift command v``` to paste  values only
    - When you are finished Column G should have no nos on it
    - If they are a chair of a committee you will have to update the ChairChart Sheet
      - Look for their name and then update column B and C
    - Go to the ALL HOUSE or ALL SENATE sheet Select all the cells
    - Go to the Custom menu select "Borders for non empty cells" to add borders to any chair graphic that is missing them
  - Go to Paperless Inscriber Sheet
    - Find old member and remove them or add the new one
  - Go to Inscriber create or update graphic and save it at the correct number.
